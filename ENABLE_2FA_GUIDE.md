1. Look for "2-Step Verification" in the security options
2. Click on "2-Step Verification"
3. Click "Get Started"
4. Choose your verification method (usually phone number is easiest)
5. Enter your phone number
6. Google will send a verification code to your phone
7. Enter the code to verify
8. Add a backup phone number (optional but recommended)
9. Turn on 2-Step Verification

## Step 3: Generate App Password
Once 2FA is enabled:
1. Go back to: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
2. Now you'll see the App passwords option
3. Select "Mail" from the dropdown
4. Select "Other (Custom name)" from the device dropdown
5. Enter: "NepaRates OTP"
6. Click "Generate"
7. Copy the 16-character password (it will look like: xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx)

## Step 4: Give Me the Details
Provide me with:

## Important Notes:
- 2FA is required for App passwords
- App passwords are 16 characters long

- You can revoke app passwords anytime

## Alternative: Use Phone Number
If you don't want to use your phone number, you can:
1. Use the Google Authenticator app
2. Use a security key
3. Use backup codes

## Troubleshooting:
If you don't see "2-Step Verification":
- Make sure you're signed into the correct Google Account
- Try refreshing the page
- Check if your account is managed by an organization (might need admin approval)
